                I am a web developer from Seattle, Washington, USA. I focus on
                creating simple, elegant websites that are accessible and pleasant
                on the eyes while maintaining maximum utility. Keeping in mind that
                a website is often the first impressionn of a company or any other
                entity in the modern world, I ensure my client makes a good one. My
                passions outside of web development include reading, writing,
                running, and photography. My love for the outdoors often influences
                my work conceptually and aesthetically.
